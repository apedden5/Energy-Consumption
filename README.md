# Energy-Consumption
This project aims to find a machine learning model to predict daily energy consumption based on historical data and key factors.  By lining up energy production with demand, this model will reduce waste, decrease costs, and minimize environmental impact, providing valuable insights for more efficient resource management.

Skill issue if you cant get it working tbh
